# About me

Hi! My name is Patrik and I am a designer and a developer from Finland.
I've been working as a freelancer with my online and local communities for the past three years,
producing all kinds of creative goods from logos to websites and even a couple videos.
I love to keep things minimal and convey my message via colors and shapes.

## Skills

My education and interest have led me to develop a wide array of skills in web development and design.
Working on all sorts of different creative projects has equipped me with problem-solving skills and
a certain flexibility to handle many functions and topics as seen in my portfolio.

## Programs

In my three years of design work I have mastered industry standard software such as Adobe Photoshop,
Illustrator, After effects and Adobe XD. On the web development side of things, I mostly use React on the frontend
and NodeJS on the backend. Im always exploring all kinds of new technologies and different ways of building the web to
improve myself and to make my own workflows more efficient.
